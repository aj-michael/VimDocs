VimDocs
=======

Hey there. This is a replica of the ever-popular text editor, ViM. Not all commands are supported yet, as I am still in the process of developing it. My goal is to support concurrent access by multiple users on the same document.

The project can be viewed at aj-michael.github.io/VimDocs
